# Book Organizer

## Description

Weâ€™ve created the all in one place for book researchers and readers, that also allows for the creation of your own library that you can revisit whenever you want. Our motivation was to develop an app that allows users to discover, explore, and organize their favorite books and other valuable information.

#### Install/Use

No install necessary; to use please visit https://nicholascatalano.github.io/book-organizer/. When loaded onto the webpage, first start by typing in the name of the book or historical work you'd like to research. When you click submit, Library of Congress results should appear on the right side of the page, including the title, description, and a button that will take you to the Library of Congress website of that item.

Under purchase results, you will find a link to preview the book using the google books api and/or links to purchase the item.

If you'd like to save that link, you can click the save button. And down the line if you'd like to remove it from the list, simply click the trash icon.
